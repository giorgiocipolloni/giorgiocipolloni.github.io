After obtaining my PhD 2021 under the supervision of [László Erdős](https://ist.ac.at/en/research/erdoes-group/) at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria, since September 2021 I have been a research fellow at the [Princeton Center for Theoretical Science](https://pcts.princeton.edu). My research interests are probability theory and mathematical physics with a focus on random matrices and dynamical systems.
